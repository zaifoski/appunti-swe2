EMPATHY DRIVEN DESIGN
riassunto da slide
------------------------------
------------------------------

THE DESIGN THINKING PROCESS:
 - Empathize
 - Define
 - Ideate
 - Prototype
 - Test

PRINCIPLES

 - Bias toward action
 - Collaborate accross boundries
 - Focus on human values
 - Be mindful of process
 - Prototype towars a solution
 - Show don't tell


How to: EMPHATIZE - DEFINE - IDEATE

1. prepare for the day, review the plan
2. go. interview, observe.
3. unpack. share. get the data on the wall.
4. synthesize needs and insights

"EMPATHIZING" -> DISCOVER THE EMOTIONS THAT GUIDE BEHAVIORS
• Observe
• Engage
• Immerse

• No judging
• Question everything
• Be curious
• Find patterns
• Absorb. Be present to what people say. 

FIND EXTREME USERS
• People who overstress needs
• They often make a need apparent, but the same need is shared by everybody
  (Example: simplicity)

OBSERVE
• what: write down what a person is doing
• how: how is the person doing it? effort? rush? pain? use adjectives
• why: why people do that, and in that way? informed guesses on motivations and emotions

INTERVIEW FOR EMPATHY
Talk to people to understand what they need/feel. How:
• Ask why - even when you think you know the answer.
• Encourage stories
• Look for inconsistencies between what people say and what they
  do: they are very revealing of opportunities
• Look at nonverbal cues
• Don’t fear silence.
• Do not suggest answers. Ask neutral questions. Listen.
• No binary questions. look for conversations.
• Be prepared to capture what people say.

SHARE AND CAPTURE
• share with the team
• write down insights on postits or other means
  (linoit, realtimeboard, gdoc)

  say     | think
  ---------------
  do      | feel
  
  <--------------->
  observed inferred

DEFINE
• select a point of view

IDEATE: DONE VIA BRAINSTORMING
• go for quantity
• make sure you have space
• all ideas are good
• try bold ideas
• stay on topic

SELECT IDEAS
• voting
• go for variety: 1-2 ideas from each category.. simple
  and rational, or delightful, or long shot.
    try different prototypes

PROTOTYPING
• Anything that has a physical form, from storyboards to
objects
• Why?
 - Explore, gain empathy, start a conversation
 - reduce ambiguity, even in the team
 - fail early (and cheaply)

PROTOTYPE TO TEST
• let user experience the solution (in some cases you may ask
them to prototype). Observe, listen.
• ideally, done in the context where the user would use it
• don’t spend too much time on each
• build with user in mind
• identify the variable you want to test
• it’s ok to fake functionality, try to be efficient and provide user experience
